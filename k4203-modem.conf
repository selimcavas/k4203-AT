# This file is used to switch the k4203 modem to modem mode
# You need to put this file in /etc/
# Make sure to set DisableSwitching=1 in /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf aswell


# Configuration for the usb_modeswitch package, a mode switching tool for
# USB devices providing multiple states or modes
#
# Evaluated by the wrapper script /usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch_dispatcher
#
# To enable an option, set it to "1", "yes" or "true" (case doesn't matter)
# Everything else counts as "disable"


# Disable automatic mode switching globally (e.g. to access the original
# install storage)

DisableSwitching=1

# Disable check for MBIM module presence and configuration globally (to aid
# special embedded environments). Available as per-device parameter
# 'NoMBIMCheck'

DisableMBIMGlobal=0

# Enable logging (results in a extensive report file in /var/log, named
# "usb_modeswitch_<interface-name>" and probably others

EnableLogging=0

# Optional increase of "delay_use" for the usb-storage driver; there are hints
# that a recent kernel default change to 1 sec. may lead to problems, particu-
# larly with USB 3.0 ports. Set this to at least 3 (seconds) in that case.
# Does nothing if the current system value is same or higher

#SetStorageDelay=4

# If the configuration for your Huawei modem uses the standard switching method,
# you can globally set an alternative method here which provides a different mode:
# either plain serial PPP (for older modems) or NCM which integrates nicely
# with recent Linux distributions, possibly avoiding configuration through a
# modem built-in web page. All other modems are not affected.
# Available as per-device parameter 'AltHuaweiMode'
